in a hip hop crew called WCR in my hometown Duisburg. As I grew up without my biological mother and therefore had a problematic childhood, I began to write lyrics to create a channel to process my emotions, my anger and my thoughts of how life is, and life could be. But after a while I realised that the hip hop industry, is getting more and more superficial, those who pretend to be the real gangsters, but in reality had a good upbringing, were dominating the market, as they had money for better productions. Thats when a night out in a techno club in 2007 changed my perception about music. Electronic music was something totally new to me. It has less to no lyrics, but to understand the music, you have to interpret the sounds and their elements.  It has a deeper meaning to me, than lyrics, which tell you what to feel. That sparked the fire for electronic music, and the rest is history."},{question:"Who/What is your biggest inspiration?",answer:"As I mentioned previously, I was listening to a lot of hip hop, soul and R n B. It was people like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, Tupac, BIGGIE, Gang Starr and Master Ace ( just to name a few ) who really caught me with their flows and lyrics. But then once I turned to electronic music I remember watching the Time Warp set of Richie Hawtin from 2005 and I was hooked by his skills and amazing sound with the surreal visual show. Very inspiring indeed.

I arrived in September 2019 and had a few gigs here and there, but to get attention from promoters here was pretty difficult due to a very saturated market and COVID a few months after. I am lucky that I have good friends, who really tried to help me to get my name out here. I had to fight with anxiety, insecurities and lack of self confidence, cause all of a sudden I am a nobody. It took a lot of strength to get pass that emotional hole. In Thailand I was playing 2 - 3 gigs a week, and I was lucky that I played 2 - 3 gigs a month in Berlin. When COVID struck, I was pretty lucky that I had already got myself a part time job, so I could keep myself afloat financially. This also brought me back to a more structured lifestyle, I got more healthy due not having big nights out and I learned again how it feels to be some kind of “normal“! COVID gave me a reset and I had time to think about how I want to proceed with my future, what and who is really important to me! Every negative situation can bring something positive with it, and we always have to keep in mind, that we should be grateful, that we are safe, healthy and have a roof over our head. Besides of that I had a lot of studio time and I am trying to be more comfortable with new directions that I love to create. Having a studio with some great people helps me a lot with my creativity and I am thankful to have this opportunity in Berlin, which I was missing in my time over in Bangkok."},{question:"Do you think your music has changed during a lockdown?",answer:"During lockdown I had time to experiment and collaborate with a few great musicians, artists and singers. The outcome was phenomenal and I am continuously pushing to invent myself over and over again. I think I found my identity, but always make some micro changes according to my current mood. It can be a melodic house banger but also love some ethereal downtempo. My range is quite broad, and I  never stick with just one genre. But in each track you can hear both of my worlds, the more ethno Thai elements, and the electronic German sounds."},{question:"What would be an ideal scenario for you this year?",answer:"There is nothing better than seeing the culture rising up again in the near future! We are on the right path, and I think everybody deserves to have a first big dance once we are able to be wild and free again.
