that cosmos. After 2 years I found my way as a guest to the clubs and festivals. After a while I started to play with my funkband at these events. I guess as a musician/ singer there is no way to don't get in touch with electronic music in Berlin"},{question:"Who/What is your biggest inspiration?",answer:"Life itself i would say. In these days everything and everyone connected to a concious way of life, body, soul and spirit. My Mom was and is always a big inspiration, my wife and some friends as well. On a musical Level i found first Inspiration in HipHop / RnB, old Soul- Funk and Blues music. Artists of my early days like Prince, D'Angelo and Lenny Kravitz inspirated me as a singer.In electronic music it was the berlin clubsound in general. Or for example stuff by Diynamic, the first tack i felt in love with was Solomun's Love Recycled 2 and for sure liveacts like DoP"},{question:"We all know the negative sides of COVID-19 to the music industry, but what are the positive sides you are getting out of it in life and music?",answer:"Alomst everything has something positive in it as well. At the beginning I enjoyed the time with myself, with inner engeneering, I've changed some habits and built up new routines in my life. I enjoyed and still enjoy to work in the studio and i felt less pressure, all slowed down. It was a time to figure out stuff and order yourself. In general i would say it brings new options, new space for ideas, upcoming artists, organizers and so on. In a way it regulates the scene and all old structures. It will give more relevance to the next generations and it brings people, new connections, alliances, ideas and ways together. As always burned ground is the best ground to seed and grow new things."},{question:"What are the biggest obstacles you find as a DJ/producer based in Berlin?",answer:"I've been always my own biggest Obstacle, which has different reasons. One was to make decisions, to decide for something. But I freed myself more or less from that and I'm doing better and better. I guess for me there is no obstacle which is not in my responsibilty at the end. So today i would say or that's how i feel sometimes time and the attitude, discipline and faith it needs."},{question:"Tell us about your future projects, is there something exciting to come?",answer:"Last year I worked out my DJ skills, combined with my vocal elements and my sound in general to an advanced level. So now my focus is more on creating music. For sure clubmusic will be always part of it, but I wanna focus more on other stuff too and still have to figure out how that works or how I'm able to combine it.At the moment I have to finish some projects for different producers and collaborations. After that I'll be back on my stuff, projects I do on my own or with friends, producers i choosed to work with.
