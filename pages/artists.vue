                  Estonian born, Ilona aka LICA has enjoyed a rapid ascent
                  through the Electronic music scene with her energetic and
                  mesmerising sound inspired by a spectrum of genres and
                  diversity of tempo. Touching the decks for the first time 10
                  years ago in her home country, LICA became well-known on the
                  Drum’n’Bass underground music scene orchestrating events and
                  projects.

                  Elegance. Word that describes the melody within Ana
                  Jablonski’s sound. The Brazilian artist started her career in
                  2016. Jablonski fell under the spell of house music at a young
                  age though her father, a music enthusiast. She captivates the
                  scene with her performance, versatile sound and dazzles the
                  club and fashion circuit in Brazil. Ana worked as a model for
                  ten years, though time, the young artist collected experience
                  all over the world, getting to know different cultures,
                  impacting her identity. Those years contributed to her
                  knowledge in music, becoming a DJ with good references and a
                  strong personality.
