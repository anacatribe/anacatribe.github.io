    :qanda="[ { question: 'When and why did you enter the music industry?', answer: 'I entered the music industry around 2009, when listening to music and dancing to it wasn\'t enough anymore. I needed more. So I started collecting vinyls of all my favourite tracks and everyday I would practise DJing. Everything then happened so quickly as if it was meant to be.' }, { question: 'Who inspires you and why?', answer: 'Inspiration comes from different angles, but mostly from my feelings. It could be a universal feeling like an observation of life situation. I start writing and bring meaning to it.' }, { question: 'The number of female DJ’s are growing exponentially. What do you think is changing in your career because of female inclusion?', answer: 'I think it\'s great in every aspect. Music constantly needs new creative minds. No matter male or female, we all have a place, and with full focus and devotion it will always be noticed and appreciated.' }, { question: 'What goes on your mind when you are preparing a set for a crowd? Is there a process you go through?', answer: 'I never prepare a set as such. I have a very good knowledge of my library, so I normally choose first 2 tracks to start with and from there it just flows. It all depends on the moment for me, the synergy with the crowd. Everytime I go to my gig its like a new adventure, I dont know what to expect from it.' }, { question: 'What advice would you give to aspiring females arriving now in the industry?', answer: 'Work on your skills constantly. Don\'t be afraid of experimenting with new sounds and genres. Explore and take time to find yourself.' } ]"
