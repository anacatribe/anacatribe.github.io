                  Estonian born, Ilona aka LICA has enjoyed a rapid ascent
                  through the Electronic music scene with her energetic and
                  mesmerising sound inspired by a spectrum of genres and
                  diversity of tempo. Touching the decks for the first time 10
                  years ago in her home country, LICA became well-known on the
                  Drum’n’Bass underground music scene orchestrating events and

                  Ana fell under the spell of house music at a young age
                  through her father, a music enthusiast.
                  The Brazilian artist started her
                  career in 2016 and captivated the music scene with her performance,
                  versatile sound and dazzling the club and fashion circuit in Brazil.
                  Ana worked as a model for ten years, but with time, the young artist
                  collected experience all over the world, getting to know different cultures,
                  impacting her identity. Those years contributed to her knowledge in music,
                  becoming a DJ with good references and a strong personality.

                  What the world means to Marvin Jam may be compared to a child in a candy shop.<br><br>
                  Marvin performs his outstanding, groovy sound and sets in combination with his excellent singing. Enjoying and enhancing many clubs and festivals like Sisyphos, Kater, Fusion or Feel Festival with his funkband, he began to join and support different DJs, so as well Live-Acts.<br><br>
                  Today he’s creating tracks on his own or in cooperation with different producers.
                  Emancipating himself to a solo-artist and as a DJ, his incredible tunes create an unique sound including different genres and of course featured by his lovely voice.
                  And if there’s one clean sign, is that this Dude got Taste & Style.

                  Sagan’s universe is a reflection of the past and a window into the future.
                  Ranging from 80's Punk fueled by raw drums to Disco where syncopated basses
                  take over, Sagan does not hesitate to flirt with electro, acid, dance,
                  house, techno, synth-wave, left-field, and an endless number of styles of
                  music beyond the limitations of genres.
                  With intrigue for the undiscovered, hunger for knowledge, love for music and
                  an engine fueled by curiosity, her main goal is to break the limits of the
                  obvious and the predictable, create conceptual atmospheres without losing
                  the main focus of playing with minds, and still make everyone dance.

                  Dan Buri is connecting the dots between his two worlds.
                  His German upbringing reverberates in the brooding yet melodic
                  soundscapes that he plays but his Thai roots lend him a more
                  lighthearted and the “sabai sabai” approach to everything that he does.
                  In fact, whether he’s playing deep and melodic techno or
                  organic house, his legacy in the city is defined by his
                  high-octane performances and an unparalleled ability to
                  engage and connect with the crowd. Notorious for pushing
                  boundaries into nonexistence, Dan has crafted a career out
                  of fusing together his many worlds in seamless and syncopated
                  harmony.
