                  Ana fell under the spell of house music at a young age
                  through her father, a music enthusiast.
                  The Brazilian artist started her
                  career in 2016 and captivated the music scene with her performance,
                  versatile sound and dazzling the club and fashion circuit in Brazil.
                  Ana worked as a model for ten years, but with time, the young artist
                  collected experience all over the world, getting to know different cultures,
                  impacting her identity. Those years contributed to her knowledge in music,
                  becoming a DJ with good references and a strong personality.

                  What the world means to Marvin Jam may be compared to a child in a candy shop.<br><br>
                  Marvin performs his outstanding, groovy sound and sets in combination with his excellent singing. Enjoying and enhancing many clubs and festivals like Sisyphos, Kater, Fusion or Feel Festival with his funkband, he began to join and support different DJs, so as well Live-Acts.<br><br>
                  Today he’s creating tracks on his own or in cooperation with different producers.
                  Emancipating himself to a solo-artist and as a DJ, his incredible tunes create an unique sound including different genres and of course featured by his lovely voice.
                  And if there’s one clean sign, is that this Dude got Taste & Style.
